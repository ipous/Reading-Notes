How to Solve a Coding Challenge:

1. Research that week's method or concept
- What are we learning this week
- Look it up on MDN or W3Schools
- Search for articles on the topic
- Watch videos on it
- Review notes
- Participate in class
2. Understand the problem
- Read the problem
- Identify key words or hints
- Identify the requirements
- Identify inputs
- Identify outputs
- View the test for input/output examples
3. Create a step-by-step plan (algorithm) for how you'll solve it
- Think about how this week's method/topic can be applied to solve it.
- Create a visual example with inputs
- Create a checklist of everything the function needs
- When creating an algorithm usually focus on example input/outputs
- Consider how the inputs will help get the outputs
4. Carry out the plan and write actual code
- Use your checklist, write code that will accomplish the tasks one at a time
- Complete your function
- Correct any syntax/linter errors.
- Don't forget to return solution
- Get the test to pass
5. Look back and possibly refactor your solution if it could be better
- Is the test passing?
- Does solution meet requirements?
- Does solution use this week's method?
- Can you understand code? 
- Are there other ways to refactor?
- How did others solve it?
